# RxFirestore
An RxJava2 wrapper for [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/), which is a new database solution by Firebase and is currently in beta.

#### _Note: This library has not yet been published and does not support all Firestore functionality._

#### What _does_ it support, then?
Check out the RxFirestore docs.

**Currently developed with:**
- Firestore 11.4.2
- RxJava 2.1.5

### Contributions welcome
I won't be working on this full-time, rather fast enough to support my own needs. With that said, please feel free to contribute as much as you'd like. Tests are encouraged (though there are none yet).

**Simply:**
- Clone the repo
- Add features
- Manually test by running assembleDebug or assembleRelease on the rxfirestore module and use that aar in your Android project
- Unit test

### Thank You
Thank you in advance to [kunny](https://github.com/kunny) for his [RxFirebase](https://github.com/kunny/RxFirebase)  database implementation, as I'll be mainly porting that to support Cloud Firestore.
